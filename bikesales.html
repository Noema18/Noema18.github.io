                    <h2> Cannondale Bad Habit</h2>
                    <img src="image/red%20and%20blue.png" alt="image of red and blue mountain bike">
                    <p> Plus-size tires—those between 2.7- and 3-inches wide—are the hottest trend in mountain bikes. The fatter options in that range bridge the gap between traditional models and the treads on true fat bikes, which can exceed 4 inches. Cannondale’s Bad Habit is one of the latest bikes to embody this trend, earning it a spot on our list of the best new mountain bikes of 2016. Based on the Habit, a traditional full-suspension bike with 27.5-inch wheels, this brawnier version uses wider rims and 3-inch wide tires. The plus-size update gives the bike more traction over rocky, loose, and wet terrain, though the tires roll slower than traditional tires. The Bad Habit 2 comes with a 2x10 drivetrain and RockShox fork; the more-expensive Bad Habit 1 has a single-ring drivetrain and Cannondale’s single-sided Lefty fork.

                    <p> Not long after the Ibis Ripley received a Bicycling Editors’ Choice award in 2015, Ibis changed it. It’s okay, though—the new Ripley has some nice upgrades that make it one of the best mountain bikes of 2016. The new model comes with better pivot internals, a lower seat mast that accommodates more dropper posts, better tire clearance, nifty chain-slap protectors, a threaded BB (the previous version used a press-fit design), and a Boost 148 option. All those small refinements should make an excellent bike even better. For 2016, Ibis also offers another option, the Ripley LS. The new version has updated geometry with a longer reach, slacker head angle (67.5 vs. 69.2), lower bottom bracket, and longer wheelbase. We loved the 2015 version, but the LS, so far, seems even nicer.

                    <h2> Rocky Mountain Blizzard -50</h2>
                    <img src="image/17HJLW275LSCHSTXXRMB_Matte_Grey_is.jpeg" alt="image of black and white mountain bike">
                    <p> For years, Rocky Mountain had a model called the Blizzard. At the time, it seemed like a strange name for a mountain bike. But when the fat bike trend took off, the company's product managers took full advantage of that trademark. The -50’s aluminum frame has a 100mm BB and 197mm rear-axle spacing that provide clearance for the 4.7-inch tires. Up front, Rocky gives it a 120mm RockShox Bluto fork for squishing though the snow—and rocks, and mud, and almost any other type of terrain. Rocky even adds mounts to the main triangle for frame bags, making it easier to equip the Blizzard for overnight adventures.
